                <p>When his parents go to work overseas, the protagonist is sent to live with his uncle in the small country town of Inaba. Shortly after his arrival, a series of bizarre murders begins, where the cause of death is	unknown and the bodies are found hanging from high places. The deaths are not the only ominous shadow creeping into the sleep town’s atmosphere; a rumor begins to spread that on rainy nights, the “Midnight Channel” plays on switched-off television sets, showing the viewer his or her soulmate…</p>
                <p>As the Murders continue, the protagonist and his companions discover a door to another world in their search for the culprit. The key to this door is the power within their soul; their other – their Personas.</p>

                <p>This document contains general tips about Persona 4 golden. This guide will not go in-depth, but it should provide you with enough information to complete the game.  We will tackle both the social and combat aspects of the game. The game is easy enough that you shouldn't need any sort of guide. We recommend forgoing this doc altogether and playing the game blind.</p>

        <section id="Saving" class="main-section">
            <header class="centertxt">Saving</header>
                <p>The game will give a number choices that can affect the ending of your game. We advised that you save often. This will allow you to load your save and play from a specific point within a game. There will also be moments in the game where it will suggest that you save. Be sure to make a different save file when that happens. You can save by going to the flying blue butterfly in the shopping district, TV world and your classroom. You can also save by going to the calendar in Dojima’s residence.

        <section id="Schedule_and_time_management" class="main-section">
            <header class="centertxt">Schedule and time management</header>
                <p>Prioritize saving the person stuck in the TV first. This is important as the game will end if you fail to perform your rescue in time. You will not lose or gain any time by doing this. After the rescue you can focus on strengthening your social links and your social stats. The Main character will check the midnight channel automatically so you don’t need to do it manually. You can check the important dates on the calendar inside mc’s room.</p>

        <section id="Social_Links_and_Social_Stats" class="main-section">
            <header class="centertxt">Social Links and Social Stats</header>
                <p>Social Links are bonuses that you use when fusing personas. You can  increase them by spending time with other characters or doing jobs. Social stats on the other hand are what determines what dialogue choices and actions you can make. You can improve your social stats by performing tasks or jobs. For example, studying or reading in your room may increase your knowledge. You can get jobs by going to the Town Bulletin Board on the Northside of the shopping district. Note that some jobs and social links are locked behind social stats.</p>

        <section id="TV_world" class="main-section">
            <header class="centertxt">TV world</header>
                <p>Before entering the tv world, swing by the shopping district to upgrade and buy items first. Be sure to sell all your material in Daidara Metalworks. You can fight shadows in the TV world by going through Junes. Simply go to Junes, enter the elevator and go to the food court. From there, you can gather everyone and go to the other world. It advised that you save everytime you go inside a dungeon. Please ensure that you are well equipped before engaging in combat. The first thing you should do before engaging in combat is to make sure that you are in control of all your teammates. Go to tactics and choose direct command. Avoid letting that AI waste their own sp. Explore the entirety of the floor and try to open as much chess as possible before moving to the next floor.</p>

        <section id="Combat" class="main-section">
            <header class="centertxt">Combat</header>
                <p>Remember the battles are team battle’s. Utilize your teammates abilities by taking direct command as mentioned previously. Take advantage of your enemies weaknesses by hitting their weak spot. You can find their weakness by trying every element on an enemy. Once you find their weakness, this data is recorded automatically. You can view this date using analyze and targeting  an enemy. One aspect of combat that is often forgotten is the support abilities. Support abilities allow you to cover your team’s weaknesses and enhance your abilities. An example of this is the spell <code>Fire wall</code>. This spell can cover Chie’s weakness to fire.  Using a combination of support skills and attack skills can increase the damage you deal further. An example of this would be using the spells <code>Rakunda</code>, <code>Tarukaja</code>, and any physical spells. To use this combo, follow these steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use <code>Rakunda</code> or other similar spells to weaken the enemies’ defense.</li>
                    <li>Use <code>Tarukaja</code> or other similar spells to increase the strength of your allies.</li>
                    <li>Perform any physical attack.</li>
                </ul>

        <section id="Spells_you_should_know" class="main-section">
            <header class="centertxt">Spells you should know</header>
                <p>There are many spells within the game and it is unlikely that you will use all of them. The following are spells that you should at least be aware of.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>Makajam</code> - silences the enemy and prevents them from using skills</li>
                        <li><code>Patra</code> / <code>Mepatra</code> - dispels rage, fear, and confusion</li>
                        <li><code>Dia</code> / <code>Media</code> - Heals ally or allies</li>
                        <li>Wall spells -  give elemental resistances</li>
                        <li><code>Sukajaja</code> / <code>Masukajaja</code> - increase evasion and hit rate</li>
                    </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="Items" class="main-section">
            <header class="centertxt">Items</header>
                <p>It is not unusual of players to be overly cautious and hoard items. However, there are plenty of items, and you shouldn't be afraid of running out. It is better to use it and not have it, than to have it after the game has already ended. If you’re intent on hoarding your items, at least use them liberally on bosses.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Weapons,_Armor,_and_Accessories" class="main-section">
            <header class="centertxt">Weapons, Armor, and Accessories</header>
                <p>Weapons, Armor, and Accessories can be bought in Daidara Metalworks or be found in chests inside dungeons. Equip your character with appropriate equipment. Take Ice Suppressor for example. This accessory increases evasion to ice and is good on character weak to ice like Yukiko. Likewise, Fire Suppressor is a good accessory for Chie because of her weakness to fire attacks.</p>
